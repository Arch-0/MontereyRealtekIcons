#Realtek BigSur/Monterey WiFi Icons

The Default icons look really bad and for that reason I decided to create my own.

Created using SF Fonts and Photoshop.

#Installation

**Script**
To use the script open a Terminal Window in the project's folder and run:
`sh installationScript.sh`

You will be prompted to logout so the changes can be applied!


**Manual Installation**

Copy the icons from the theme of your choosing and move them to:
`/Library/Application Support/WLAN/StatusBarApp.app/Contents/Resources`

To open `StatusBarApp.app` you can right click on it and then `Show Package Contents`

You will need to logout so the changes can be applied!

Here is how it looks:

**Annoyances**

The icons don't change based on System theme.
I will be looking for a solution to that problem in the near future.
